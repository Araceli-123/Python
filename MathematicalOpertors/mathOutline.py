#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

var = " Hello" + " there"

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 + 6

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y = 9 - 1

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

g = 8.45 - 0.45

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

h = 6 * 7

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

d = "Araceli" * 3

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

v = 8 / 8

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

t = 2.4 / 2.2

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

o = 5 % 4

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

f = 4 // 4

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

a = 2 ** 2

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

b = 5 5
