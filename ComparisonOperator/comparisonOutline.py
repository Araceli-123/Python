This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a = "hello" == "hello"
b = a 
print(b)
#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
x = 3 == 4
y = x
print(y)
#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
j =  4 > 5
k = j 
print(k)
#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
v = 6 < 7
b = v
print(b)
#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
m = 8 >= 9 
n = m
print(n)
#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
q = 2 <= 8 
w = q
print(w)
#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
